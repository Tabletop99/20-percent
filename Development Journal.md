I spent today examining project 7 to learn how to create a class with a key listener and also to learn a bit about how a GUI works. I have labeled the parts of project 7 that I didn't understand previously with what they do. I should be able to begin writin my code next week.

Today I looked into how to create a class in java that can respond to keystrokes. I disovered that I need to use a key listener to do this. I found an example online that I can use to help me write my own key listener, and I can also look back at project 7 for another reference.
