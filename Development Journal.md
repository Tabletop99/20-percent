Today I looked into how to create a class in java that can respond to keystrokes. I disovered that I need to use a key listener to do this. I found an example online that I can use to help me write my own key listener, and I can also look back at project 7 for another reference. I haven't actually written any code yet, but I am set up to begin writing code next week.
