I began writing my code Friday, and I completed my first deliverable today. I now have a program that compares the typed input text to the target text and if they do not match it turns the input text red. Unfortunately, backspacing has not been implemented and so messing up one character turns everything red and the only way to make it black again is to restart. The next thing I will do is make the program compare the two texts word by word so that if a word is wrong it will only turn that word red instead of the entire thing. I'll do this by using the split method that we used in the EOC project to process commands.

I spent today examining project 7 to learn how to create a class with a key listener and also to learn a bit about how a GUI works. I have labeled the parts of project 7 that I didn't understand previously with what they do. I should be able to begin writing my code next week.

Today I looked into how to create a class in java that can respond to keystrokes. I disovered that I need to use a key listener to do this. I found an example online that I can use to help me write my own key listener, and I can also look back at project 7 for another reference.
