Proposal: TyPro: A program that will help people learn how to type faster

Drew McMains


Needs and Opportunities: Many people's lives would be improved if they could type faster
. Most people use type on computers fairly often, so a faster typing speed will help them use their time more efficiently.

Audience / Clients / Users: Anyone that types regularly will benefit from my project. Whether it be coding, typing essays, or typing emails, many people will find my project useful. I have a great pool of people to test my project on in the form of myself and my classmates.


Product: 

My project will be a program that is designed to help people type faster. It will do this by providing text for the user to type, and then displaying their words per minute based on how long it took them to type the text and how many words they got right.
Timeline: February 26: Be able to compare user input to the target text
April 1: Incorporate a timer and be able to display the user's words per minute
April 29: Allow backspacing, possibly add a GUI
Reality Check: I don't expect to have any financial issues because most if not all of my project will be done in BlueJ.


Conclusion: I am excited for this project because it will give me valuable programming experience, and it is an applicable and useful idea.
